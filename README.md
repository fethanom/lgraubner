AOT Compiler for Dual threads framework.

### Points

- Dual threads

- AOT Compile in Rust

- Zero runtime

- No Virtual DOM

- Language-level reactivity

### Motivation

More and more front-end frameworks use compilation technologies, such as svelte and solid, and more and more front-end tool chains use rust or golang. I see new ways to play with them.

At the same time, I will use dual-thread technology, which is common for RN, flutter, and miniapp, but not for web.
